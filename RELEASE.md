Release Notes
=============

R1-0 (May 29, 2019)
----
* Initial release.  This version inherits directly from ADDriver, not from ADGenICam.

R2-0 (August 12, 2019)
* This version inherits from ADGenICam.  It is considerably simpler than R1-0 because the ADGenICam base class
  handles many things.  It also supports all camera features, while R1-0 only supported a subset of the features.
